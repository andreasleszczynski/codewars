"""Sum of a sequence - 7 kyu Kata Fundamentals
Your task is to make function, which returns the sum of a sequence of integers.

The sequence is defined by 3 non-negative values: begin, end, step.

If begin value is greater than the end, function should returns 0

Examples

sequenceSum(2,2,2) === 2
sequenceSum(2,6,2) === 12 // 2 + 4 + 6
sequenceSum(1,5,1) === 15 // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
sequenceSum(1,5,3) === 5 // 1 + 4
"""

def sequence_sum(begin_number, end_number, step):
    return sum(range(begin_number, end_number+1, step))

print(sequence_sum(2, 6, 2) == 12)
print(sequence_sum(1, 5, 1) == 15)
print(sequence_sum(1, 5, 3) == 5)
print(sequence_sum(0, 15, 3) == 45)
print(sequence_sum(16, 15, 3) == 0)
print(sequence_sum(2, 24, 22) == 26)
print(sequence_sum(2, 2, 2) == 2)
print(sequence_sum(2, 2, 1) == 2)
print(sequence_sum(1, 15, 3) == 35)
print(sequence_sum(15, 1, 3) == 0)
